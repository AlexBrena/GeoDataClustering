# GeoDataClustering
Jupyter notebooks showing the process of applying clustering to geophysical data from well logs and vertical seismic profiles (VSP) to generate electrofacies, allowing the classification of geological formations. Includes data preparation, selection of clustering algorithms and visualization of results.


This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that guide the process of applying clustering techniques to geophysical data from well logs and vertical seismic profiles (VSP) to generate classes known as electrofacies. The aim is to enable the classification of geological formations using clustering analysis.
